# Software Development Portfolio

My software development portfolio built with Node.JS, React, Redux and MongoDB. I've created a custom admin backend that allows me to change the content on the site including the about me page and the projects page. 

Goals:
- Deploy a real world full stack project with node, react, redux and mongodb
- Create a portfolio that will last i.e. I can make changes without recreating it
- Have some kind of authentication aspect (the admin panel)
